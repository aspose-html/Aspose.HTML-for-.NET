# Advanced Programming Techniques in Aspose.HTML for .NET

This gist repository contains advanced C# code samples for [Aspose.HTML for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/html/net/). These examples support the scenarios covered in the [Advanced Programming](https://docs.aspose.com/html/net/advanced-programming/) section of the documentation and are intended for developers working with more complex HTML processing tasks.

## Key Topics

This repository provides advanced usage examples of the Aspose.HTML for .NET API. You will explore:

* Custom Stream Processing. Implement custom stream providers to control how output is generated and stored in memory or files.
* Memory Stream Output. Render documents directly to memory streams for use in non-file-based workflows.
* Advanced DOM manipulation with Mutation Observer. You will learn how to register and observe changes in the HTML Document tree using MutationObserver.
* Aspose CSS Extension. Use Aspose-specific CSS properties to customize the layout of your printed document, such as adding headers, footers, and page numbers.
* Editing HTML5 Canvas Content. Work with a document that contains an HTML5 Canvas element and render visual HTML output to formats like PDF.
* Using the HTML Form Editor. Programmatically manipulate HTML forms in the document, input controls, and submission.
