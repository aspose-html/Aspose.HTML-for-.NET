# Code Examples for Checking Web Accessibility 

This gist repository contains C# examples that accompany the [Web Accessibility](https://docs.aspose.com/html/net/web-accessibility/) chapter in the Aspose.HTML for .NET documentation. These examples demonstrate how to validate HTML content for accessibility according to the WCAG standard and identify errors and warnings to improve them.

- Check web documents against WCAG standards using built-in validators and accessibility rule sets.
- Check for missing alternative text in image elements.
- Evaluate color contrast and compare it to accessibility standards.
- Evaluate multimedia elements to ensure compliance with accessibility guidelines.
- Create reports describing accessibility violations found in an HTML document.
- Configure accessibility checking and use rule sets to control the level and focus of analysis.
- Query accessibility principles, guidelines, and criteria using the Aspose.HTML API.
